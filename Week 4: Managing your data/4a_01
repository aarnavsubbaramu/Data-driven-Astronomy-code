#As a warm-up, add the following stars to the existing Star table:
kepler_id 	t_eff 	radius
7115384 	3789 	27.384
8106973 	5810 	0.811
9391817 	6200 	0.958

#Have a look at the table before and after the insertion to make sure everything went fine. The automarker runs a SELECT * FROM Star query to check the result.



INSERT INTO Star (kepler_id, t_eff, radius) VALUES (7115384, 3789, 27.384), (8106973, 5810, 0.811), (9391817, 6200, 0.958); #inserting multiple tuples at once works as well
